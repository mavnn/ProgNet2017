This tutorial is designed to be an introduction to Functional Programming,
presented at Progressive .NET 2017; it will probably make a lot less sense
without my talky bits, but feel free to give it a go anyway if you're feeling
brave!

It assumes you'll be working with dotnet core 2.0.

Grab the outline for the tutorial [[/Instructions/outline.html][in the "Instructions" folder]].
